# Social-Media-Popularity-Prediction

The project introduces an innovative approach to predict content popularity on social media platforms, focusing on Flickr. Unlike existing methods, we consider the Social Network Effect (SNE) context, including group interactions, popularity, and post count.

We combine machine learning and deep learning techniques with Flickr post data analysis, considering factors like post content, user engagement, and metadata alongside group interactions.

Our approach seamlessly integrates various data types, such as image features, text content, and numerical attributes, into a unified model architecture.

Results show that considering SNE context significantly improves predictive accuracy. LightGBM model outperforms others, showcasing the importance of feature engineering and NLP techniques.

Our project offers a valuable tool for optimizing content strategies and enhancing user engagement in the visually driven landscape of platforms like Flickr.
